# Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing data related to gold recovery processes at a mining company. It encompasses data on various stages of the gold recovery process, including flotation and final concentration, as well as data on the parameters influencing the efficiency of gold extraction.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the gold recovery rate from ore. By doing so, the project aims to help optimize production processes, minimize losses, and improve the overall profitability of the gold mining operation.

## Tools and Libraries

For the successful completion of this project, the following tools and libraries were utilized:

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Steps

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing

- Load the data from CSV files.
- Validate the correctness of the recovery calculation.
- Handle missing values.
- Perform data imputation for missing values.
- Check for duplicate entries.
- Prepare the data for analysis and modeling.

### Step 2: Data Exploration and Analysis

- Investigate the variations in metal concentrations (Au, Ag, Pb) at different stages of processing.
- Examine the distributions of ore particle sizes in the training and test datasets.
- Analyze the total concentrations of substances at various processing stages.

### Step 3: Model Development

- Define a custom function to compute the final sMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error).
- Select relevant features and target variables.
- Train different machine learning models, employing cross-validation techniques.
- Optimize hyperparameters and choose the best-performing model.
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.

### Step 4: Conclusion

Summarize the findings and their implications for the gold recovery process. Provide insights into the model's predictive capabilities and any limitations.

## Findings

- The analysis revealed that variations in metal concentrations occur at different stages of the recovery process, with some metals showing significant changes.
- Particle size distributions in the training and test datasets are similar, ensuring model generalizability.
- The total concentration of substances fluctuates during processing, which may impact recovery rates.

## Possible Reasons for Data Incompleteness

Data incompleteness may result from measurement errors, equipment malfunctions, or missing records during data collection and transfer.

## Justification for Imputing Missing Values with Medians

Filling missing values with medians is a robust approach for scale variables because it is resistant to outliers and ensures that extreme values do not unduly influence the overall dataset, thereby preserving the integrity of the analysis.

## General Conclusion

This project successfully developed a machine learning model for predicting gold recovery rates from ore processing data. The model can aid in optimizing gold extraction processes and making informed decisions to enhance the overall efficiency and profitability of the mining operation.
